# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## Nice-to-have (Custom implementation responsibility)

1. Custom pull2refresh
2. Assigning functions to buttons


## TODO:

0. Do not duplicate dragged cell
1. Disable d&d in edit mode
2. Rolling scrollview
3. Reload function
4. Loading cell animation
5. Selectable rows + delegate calls
6. Sections division
7. Parametrize default layout (T/G)
8. Adjustable icon view depending on width
9. API naming cleanup 
10. UISplitViewController implementation
11. Manual (+ comments)
12. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
