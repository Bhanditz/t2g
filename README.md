# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## Nice-to-have (Custom implementation responsibility)

1. Custom pull2refresh
2. Assigning functions to buttons


## TODO:

0. Pull2ref less items + less items in model
1. Loading cell animation
2. Sections division
3. Adjustable icon view depending on width
4. API naming cleanup 
5. UISplitViewController implementation
6. Manual (+ comments)
7. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
