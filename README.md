# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## Nice-to-have (Custom implementation responsibility)

1. Custom pull2refresh
2. Assigning functions to buttons

## TODO:

1. Sections division
2. API naming cleanup + Manual (+ comments)
3. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
