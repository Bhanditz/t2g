# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## Nice-to-have (Custom implementation responsibility)

1. Custom pull2refresh
2. Assigning functions to buttons


## TODO:

1. Disable d&d in edit mode
2. Reload function
3. Loading cell animation
4. Selectable rows + delegate calls
5. Sections division
6. Parametrize default layout (T/G)
7. Adjustable icon view depending on width
8. API naming cleanup 
9. UISplitViewController implementation
10. Manual (+ comments)
11. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
