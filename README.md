# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## TODO:

0. Reload function
1. Loading cell animation
2. Assigning functions to buttons
3. Parametrize all possible features
    - swipe cell function
    - default layout (T/G)
4. Adjustable icon view depending on width
5. API naming cleanup
6. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
7. UISplitViewController implementation
8. Manual (+ comments)
