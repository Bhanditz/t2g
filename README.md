# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## TODO:

1. CRUD functions
2. Delete/Add animations
3. Assigning functions to buttons
4. Parametrize all possible features
    - swipe cell function
    - default layout (T/G)
5. Adjustable icon view depending on width
6. API naming cleanup
7. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
8. UISplitViewController implementation
9. Manual
