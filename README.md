# Table2Grid Concept

Implementation of table view that is switchable to collection view along with all the goodies known in both - be it obvious things such as standard protocol for populating the view or not so obvious, but still nice thing - dynamic loading and smooth transition animations.

## Nice-to-have (Custom implementation responsibility)

1. Custom pull2refresh
2. Assigning functions to buttons


## TODO:

1. Reload function
2. Loading cell animation
3. Selectable rows + delegate calls
4. Sections division
5. Parametrize default layout (T/G)
6. Adjustable icon view depending on width
7. API naming cleanup 
8. UISplitViewController implementation
9. Manual (+ comments)
10. Proper licence (Apache 2.0 / BSD / MIT)
